<h1>JOINED FORCES</h1>

<h2>Chapter One</h2>

<p>King Jacob Fitzroy had been king for a year short of four decades. He was aging but still spirited, carefully guiding his eldest son and heir, Prince Luthor, to lead like himself, with an iron first.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you understand?&rsquo; he asked one evening, a week before the Conference.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course, Father,&rsquo; drawled Luthor. He had Jacob&rsquo;s features, the strong jaw, wiry hair, straight nose and grey, pale eyes, but his mother&rsquo;s dark hair. The King youthful red hair was greying rapidly now.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It all depends on that wretched monk&rsquo;s boy,&rsquo; sighed Jacob, fiddling with the inherited signet ring on his right hand. They were stood on one of the palace balconies, overlooking the grounds and the colonial city of Correx beyond.</p>

<p>Correx was the largest of the three cities on the isle of Galmon, situated on one side of a large river, usually filled with military boats &ndash; Correx&rsquo;s army and navy were its first and foremost prides. The city had been planned perfectly, by a master architect employed by one of the Fitzroy&rsquo;s ancestors many centuries ago &ndash; thirty-nine streets parallel to the river stretched northwards, housing those who worked in the farms, factories and mines beyond. The three roads closest to the river housed shops, restaurants and conveniences &ndash; stables for the royal horses, and carriages for those of importance.</p>

<p>Across the river, the Palace of Correx, a brutal, grey mansion, with vast grounds of oaken trees and lakes brimming with carp, overlooked one side of the city, closest to the mouth of the river. On the opposite side of the main road was a huge arena, where the Correxian people flocked (or were herded) for events in which the King displayed the continuing power of the monarchy &ndash; barbaric jousting or fencing competitions, pageantries and parades. Behind the arena was the military base, and the city prison, a miserable building which, oddly enough, resembled the palace.</p>

<p>One day, thought Luthor, this will all be mine. And soon, he hoped.</p>

<p>The prince huffed as he came back to reality, and turned to his father to reply to the remark.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Adam Anderson&rsquo;s a fool. He&rsquo;ll choose religion over ruling that silly little village, I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good. Then that leaves you to marry the di Medici girl, and take over the running of Pam and Hanopax when the time is right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Must I marry her? I can barely stand the sight of her. She&rsquo;s been given too much freedom; she thinks that she&rsquo;s entitled to be First Minister, just like her mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be so petulant. You&rsquo;re twenty years of age, stop acting like a child. You will marry her. I had to do the same with your mother, did I not? These sacrifices are necessary for the good of the family, boy. You take heed of that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Luthor rolled his eyes when Jacob wasn&rsquo;t looking. His father was lost in thought, Luthor assumed. In reality, he was concocting a highly-detailed plan of succession, that would ensure the power of his sons, and their sons, for many decades to come.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Now, where&rsquo;s that brother of yours gotten to?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;He&rsquo;s probably with Skylar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;I want him briefed on what he&rsquo;s to do. The di Medici girl has a younger sister.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;You want to marry us both off in the course of a week?&rsquo; sniggered Luthor.</p>

<p>Jacob didn&rsquo;t return the smile, but cracked his knuckles over the balcony instead.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the idea. Now go and fetch your brother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, Father,&rsquo; he muttered, turning on his heel and marching out of his father&rsquo;s chambers.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take Luthor long to find Edmund. As he suspected, he was with Skylar, the king&rsquo;s Chief Advisor. The pair were engaged in a rather intense game of chess in one of the palace drawing rooms, and didn&rsquo;t notice the prince enter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whoops,&rsquo; said Luthor, with a smirk. He toppled Edmund&rsquo;s King with one long finger, startling the two players.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; asked Edmund irritably. Skylar kept his eyes down.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not me. Father wants you. He&rsquo;s in his study, on the balcony.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I see.&rsquo; He rose to his feet, habitually dusting nothing off of him with one hand. &lsquo;That was a good game, Skylar. We&rsquo;ll resume after I speak to 
Father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see you shortly,&rsquo; said Skylar, beginning to tidy the chess set away. Luthor perched on the dark oak desk, opposite the chess table, examining his fingernails.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to play with me, Skylar?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know full well that you have no interest in intellectual pursuits, Your Highness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And darling Edmund does?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He will never be King. He has to dedicate himself to something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad that my little brother is finding some hobbies to entertain himself with. Sleep well now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Luthor hopped down from the desk, and strolled across the room. He took a second to admire the family portrait, of himself, his brother and the King, housed between two floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. With a sniff of approval, he left the study once more.</p>

<p>Skylar could hardly believe that Luthor and Edmund were related, let alone twins &ndash; and identical to boot. Four minutes was all that separated them, and Skylar often found himself wondering if Edmund would have turned out the same way as his brother if he had been the heir. Jacob had eyes only for his eldest son, whilst Skylar had practically raised Edmund, a kindly, quiet young man, with a penchant for academic matters as opposed to the battlefield, which seemed to be Luthor&rsquo;s natural realm. He supposed it would have been the same either way &ndash; if Edmund had been the eldest, Jacob would have moulded him into a prot&eacute;g&eacute; psychopath by this point. Skylar sighed, and mused his own past instead.</p>

<p>King Jacob of Correx&rsquo;s greatest achievement was arguably subduing the entire continent of Usonia &ndash; the traders of the North and the farmers of the South, and creating a colony to strengthen the power of his own city over the two others &ndash; the industrial Pam, and the religious Hanopax. Usonia had submitted one of their greatest leaders, Skylar Ellingham, a young man (whose lover, Dominic Anderson, had once been heir to Pam) as an advisor to Jacob&rsquo;s household, in order to stop their lands being pillaged and destroyed.</p>

<p>Skylar had mixed feelings about his fate. He&rsquo;d successfully protected his people, and Dominic, but their willingness to submit him to an unknown devil was rather concerning. When he filled out his ledger books, his heart often fell at the miniscule level of rations Jacob provided the Usonian people with. Skylar often changed the number of bushels at the last minute, without the King&rsquo;s knowledge, so that his people wouldn&rsquo;t starve.</p>

<p>He hadn&rsquo;t heard from his family, or Dominic, in thirty-five years. He knew from his contacts what Dominic was up to, but tragically, it was simply too dangerous for the pair of them to make contact.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;d stopped feeling like an outsider. His accent was different to everyone else&rsquo;s, but it was softer now than it had been. He was a noticeable man &ndash; tall, bald, with dark skin, something not particularly common in Correx. He&rsquo;d had plenty of stares when he was first dragged off the boat all those years ago, but everyone knew him as the King&rsquo;s most trusted advisor now.</p>

<p>And yet . . .</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m back,&rsquo; said Edmund, closing the door behind him. Skylar rose to his feet, his cogitations disrupted.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Father wants me to seduce Alexandra di Medici,&rsquo; he sighed, seating himself at the chess table. &lsquo;Not at this Conference, he says it&rsquo;d be too obvious if Luthor starts flirting with Olivia as well, but he wants me to try and get to know her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How do you feel about that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how I feel. I don&rsquo;t have a choice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Edmund, you can have an opinion too, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Edmund contemplated this alien proposition for a moment, whilst Skylar continued.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with it, don&rsquo;t do it. Besides, Joan&rsquo;ll see right through the plan. And . . .&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you know why His Highness has been in such a bad mood lately?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No. Why?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s due for release in two days. He&rsquo;s the only man your father ever feared.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;His old General? From the war? Ludovic di Medici?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll be the one signing his release papers. I&rsquo;m going later tonight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I met him when I was a boy. He was a nice man. I don&rsquo;t understand why Father&rsquo;s so afraid of him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I only met Ludo when he was a bit older, but I know the stories. They were at the military academy together, your father and Ludo, and Ludo was always getting beaten up. Scrawny little boy, he was, even when I first saw him, and he was twenty-one then. Short-sighted, skinny young man, but his father was Eric di Medici, one of the finest army Commanders in the history of this nation. No one could believe how useless Ludo was in combat. But it turned out that he wasn&rsquo;t useless. He&rsquo;s a pacifist, would you believe? He was your father&rsquo;s favourite punching bag when they were at school, but one day, he had enough, and challenged your father to a duel. Just for fun, nothing serious.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And Father lost?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t just lose. He was utterly humiliated. Ludo could predict every single move that your father was going to make. He&rsquo;s a master tactician. Your father was furious. But, he came to respect Ludo after that, and had him employed as his army General.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But Ludo&rsquo;s from Pam, not Correx.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes. But he isn&rsquo;t of noble birth, you see, and that caused some issues with his marriage to Joan.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thought his father was Eric di Medici.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He was adopted at birth. Jocelyn, Eric&rsquo;s wife, couldn&rsquo;t have children. It was all right when Joan was just the third child who was never going to inherit anything, but once Dominic abdicated and she had to become First Minister, it wasn&rsquo;t seen as appropriate to have her marry someone of such low birth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But he <em>did</em> marry her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Constitution states that there are exceptions to the rules of marriage. Those of a certain rank can marry others of a certain rank, regardless of their birth. How do you think he ended up working for your father?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Edmund chewed on this issue for a moment. He enjoyed toying with the snippets of information Skylar provided him. Jacob had always made Correx the focus of his studies and conversations, but Edmund longed to learn as much as he could about the Old World, and the other settlements of the New one.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because father saw an opportunity to elevate him to army General, and have him on his side. Pam already had a powerful army at the time, and didn&rsquo;t need a General, especially not someone so young and inexperienced. Ludo and Joan wanted to get married so desperately that he took the chance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Skylar knew it would have taken Luthor much longer to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Exactly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Edmund smiled wryly, pleased with himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d make a fine king,&rsquo; said Skylar, and there was nothing for the pair of them to do except for laugh.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>After Edmund had retreated to his chambers, and Skylar had made sure that the King was comfortable and knew the details of tomorrow&rsquo;s schedule, he got to work in his study.</p>

<p>Skylar&rsquo;s rooms were not particularly impressive, but he was not housed in the servants&rsquo; quarters, at least. He had a decent view of the river, his own bathroom and kitchenette, and workers at his beck and call if he needed them &ndash; not that he ever did.</p>

<p>He had written the letter for Ludo&rsquo;s release. Ten years had flown by. He still remembered the day that Ludo had been sentenced. Jacob was furious at Ludo&rsquo;s blank stare, with no emotion as he was led away from court. Skylar was with the General as he was locked in his cell for the first time. It was only then that he cried.</p>

<p>What difference did a day make, thought Skylar, as he telegrammed Ludo&rsquo;s release for tomorrow night, instead of the following evening.</p>

<p>He simply hoped that the Conference would run as smoothly as it had done this last decade with Jacob&rsquo;s worst enemy in attendance.</p>
